long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out this Recipe Maker project and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

  Primary goal of this project to get better at JavaScript/React skills. Creating a good design with HTML and CSS is a bonus! 

  You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

  Your users should be able to:

  - Try to implement all features implemented in live demo: https://recipe-maker.netlify.app  

  - Download the starter code and go through the README.md file.

  The `README.md` file will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.html` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.

  Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All the best.
